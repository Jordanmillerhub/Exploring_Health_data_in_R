#The 4 varibles I will be examining are Estimated Functional Capacity(FC60_), ever told of have depression (ADDEPEV2), adults who have been told they have high blood pressure (_RFHYPE5), and being told they have asthma (_LTASTH1)
#Main objective is to analyze this data spotting trends in predicting capacity with a mental health issue vs having a common physical ailment. 

#Removing outliers using the quartile method because there is a large range of numbers. First, removing 99900 from the dataset because it is not set to 2 implied decimals but the rest of FC60_ is. If I do not remove this, it will alter my numbers when I divide by 100 to set the 2 decimals places later. I will be removing from capacity(FC60_) as it is the main numerical variable I will be predicting. This will make my regressions and other tests more reliable.

#to start I am doing a regression with all of my variables as predictors. Interesting to note they are all signifcant and P values are similar (most likely due to 1 and 2 being used as yes/no) however, importaatnt to look at the coefficient in terms of how the yes and no's are structured. 
#using this regression, as depression goes from 1 (yes to depression) to 0. it decreases capacity (coefficient is -.04). So people with depression have higher capacity. Also, people with astma (having is 2) have higher capacity (coefficient is .05). Also interesting. The only one that follows my original thoughts is high blood pressure. People having high blood pressure lose capacity (coefficient is -.37) this is also the highest standardized coeeficent.
